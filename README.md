# Cashier

This program is my cashier for the gamenight that me and my girlfriend will be selling a sweet called 'palha italiana' in portuguese, in the University of SÃ£o Paulo. The interface is all written in portuguese.

The program has a first CLI for configuring the number of each 'palha' that we will be selling. Then appears a GUI of the actual cashier, in which one can add the 'palha' that the customer wants to buy and calculate the price.
Also, the program keeps the stock updated and adds each selling to a receipt to keep track of sellings.

The receipt is saved as a excel file in the directory where you run the program.
